# Car Physics Demo
 
This is a demo project created in GameMaker Studio 2. I tested some options and approaches using Box2D and wanted to create a pure GML version to allow for more control and (this is not validated) easier multiplayer support.

The foundations for this project are both the [paper outlining](https://asawicki.info/Mirror/Car%20Physics%20for%20Games/Car%20Physics%20for%20Games.html) the math behind the physics for cars in games by Marco Monster and the sample [project source code](https://github.com/spacejack/carphysics2d) by Spacejack.
